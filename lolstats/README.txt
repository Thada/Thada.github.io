Overview:
LoL Stats is a web application that I created as a side project.  It runs using JavaScript, so JavaScript must be enabled for it to function.  LoL Stats also uses Bootstrap, Chart.js, and some jQuery.

Examples:
If you are unfamiliar with any player names, try searching for the following Summoners:
