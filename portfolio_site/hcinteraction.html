	<p>For this project I worked in a team of 3 people to create a prototype desktop application that would help teach young students about molecules. The application was created using Adobe Director, which utilized Lingo scripts. 3D models were created using <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">SketchUp</a>, and parts of the HUD were created using Adobe Illustrator. While a mouse or touch display were primary modes of input, the application was intended to be used with <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">LeapMotion</a> controls. Below is a user scenario, as well as screenshots from a particular lesson.</p>
